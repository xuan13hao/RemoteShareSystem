# Desktop Sharing System
## Preface
There are already many remote desktop control products. My original intention of this project is not to develop a commercial product, but to do an open source project out of hobbies. I have never read the source code of any remote desktop control project before. Just designed and developed based on my existing experience, there must be many shortcomings. I am open to receive different ideas to modify and optimize.
## Introduce
It has two modules- Client and Server.
Run the server code on the system you want to control remotely and the client code on the system you are working on. Run the server side code first, which prompts you to set the password after which it waits the client to connect to it. 
Now run the client side code and enter the IP Address of the server and the password set by you in the next two windows that appear. If the IP address and the password entered are correct you will be able to monitor and control the server screen from your system.
